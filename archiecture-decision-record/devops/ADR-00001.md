# ADR-00001

## Requirement

We should have fully isolation between our application resources and DevOps resource.

Version: 1.0.0

----------
## Decision Consideration 1

We creates specific a namespace for DevOps related services. This helps to maintains the resources, security, isolation, monitoring, etc. for these service.  


- Separate namespaces for different environments can help manage and isolate resources and workloads.
- Different roles and permissions can be assigned to users or service accounts within specific namespaces, providing fine-grained access control.
- Namespaces provide a way to logically group related resources, making it easier to manage and navigate through the cluster.
- Limit ranges can be defined to specify the minimum and maximum compute resources that can be requested by containers in a namespace, helping to control resource allocation and utilization.
----------
## Decision Consideration 2
****
We creates separate Kubernetes cluster for this workload.
