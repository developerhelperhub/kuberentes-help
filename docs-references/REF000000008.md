Use case and benefit Oauth2 protocol 

The OAuth 2.0 protocol is widely used for authorization, allowing third-party applications to access user resources without exposing user credentials. Below is an overview of a typical use case for OAuth 2.0.
**Use Case: Third-Party Application Accessing User's Calendar**
**Scenario:** A user wants to grant a third-party application access to their calendar so it can add events on their behalf.
Steps:

1. **Authorization Request:**
    - The third-party application directs the user to the OAuth 2.0 authorization server with an authorization request.
    - The request includes:
        - Client ID (issued by the authorization server)
        - Redirect URI (where the authorization server will send the user after granting or denying access)
        - Scope (specifying the level of access, e.g., read/write access to the calendar)
        - State (a random string to protect against CSRF attacks)
2. **User Authentication and Consent:**
    - The user is redirected to the authorization server's login page.
    - The user logs in and is presented with a consent screen detailing the access the third-party application is requesting.
    - The user grants or denies access.
3. **Authorization Response:**
    - If the user grants access, the authorization server redirects the user back to the redirect URI with an authorization code.
    - If the user denies access, the server redirects back with an error message.
4. **Access Token Request:**
    - The third-party application sends a request to the authorization server's token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for an access token.
    - The request includes:
        - Authorization code
        - Client ID and Client Secret (issued by the authorization server)
        - Redirect URI (to verify it matches the one used in the authorization request)
5. **Access Token Response:**
    - If the authorization code is valid, the authorization server responds with an access token and optionally a refresh token.
    - If the request is invalid, the server responds with an error.
6. **Accessing Protected Resources:**
    - The third-party application uses the access token to make requests to the resource server (e.g., the calendar API) on behalf of the user.
    - The resource server validates the access token and returns the requested resources.
7. **Token Refresh (Optional):**
    - If the access token expires, the third-party application can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.

**Example OAuth 2.0 Flow**
**Authorization Request:**

    arduino
    Copy code
    GET /authorize?response_type=code
    &client_id=CLIENT_ID
    &redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI
    &scope=calendar.read%20calendar.write
    &state=RANDOM_STRING

**Authorization Response:**

    less
    Copy code
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: REDIRECT_URI?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=RANDOM_STRING

**Token Request:**

    bash
    Copy code
    POST /token
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    grant_type=authorization_code
    &code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
    &redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI
    &client_id=CLIENT_ID
    &client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET

**Token Response:**

    json
    Copy code
    {
      "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "refresh_token": "REFRESH_TOKEN"
    }

**Accessing Protected Resource:**

    sql
    Copy code
    GET /calendar/events
    Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN

**Key Points:**

- **Client ID and Client Secret:** Used to identify the application to the authorization server.
- **Authorization Code:** A temporary code exchanged for an access token.
- **Access Token:** Used to access protected resources.
- **Refresh Token:** Used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
- **Scope:** Defines the level of access requested by the third-party application.

This flow ensures that user credentials are not exposed to third-party applications and access is granted with the user's explicit consent.
