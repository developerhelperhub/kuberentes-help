How to connect docker API from machine another machine docker Desktop

----------

To connect to the Docker API on another machine running Docker Desktop (or any Docker host), you can use the Docker Remote API. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set this up, including securing the connection using TLS:
**1. Enable Docker API on the Remote Machine**
Docker Desktop (Windows and macOS) doesn’t directly expose the Docker API over TCP by default. You need to enable this feature manually.
**On Windows:**

1. **Access Docker Desktop Settings:**
    - Right-click the Docker icon in the system tray and choose "Settings."
2. **Enable the TCP Socket:**
    - Go to "Docker Engine" and add a configuration for the `"hosts"` key, for example:
    {
      "hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2375", "npipe://"]
    }
    - Note: This example enables both the named pipe (for local access) and TCP (for remote access).
1. **Apply and Restart:**
    - Click "Apply & Restart" to apply the changes.

**On macOS:**

1. **Access Docker Desktop Settings:**
    - Click the Docker icon in the menu bar and go to "Preferences."
2. **Enable the TCP Socket:**
    - Similar to Windows, modify the "Docker Engine" settings to include:
    {
      "hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"]
    }
1. **Apply and Restart:**
    - Apply the changes and restart Docker Desktop.

**2. Secure the Connection with TLS (Recommended)**
Exposing Docker over TCP without TLS is insecure, as it can be intercepted or misused. It's recommended to secure the connection with TLS:

1. **Generate Certificates:**
    - Create a CA (Certificate Authority) and generate a server certificate for the Docker host. Also, generate a client certificate for the machine that will connect to the Docker host.
2. **Configure Docker to Use TLS:**
    - Place the server certificate and key on the Docker host and configure Docker to use them. Modify the `daemon.json` file to include:
    {
      "tls": true,
      "tlscacert": "/path/to/ca.pem",
      "tlscert": "/path/to/server-cert.pem",
      "tlskey": "/path/to/server-key.pem",
      "hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2376"]
    }
    - Restart the Docker service.

**3. Connect from the Client Machine**
On the client machine (the machine from which you want to control Docker):

1. **Install Docker Client:**
    - Ensure the Docker client is installed on your machine.
2. **Set Docker Environment Variables:**
    - Export the environment variables to point to the remote Docker host and use the client certificates:
    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://<REMOTE_DOCKER_IP>:2376
    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/client/certs
1. **Test the Connection:**
    - Run a Docker command, such as `docker info`, to verify the connection.
    docker info

This should return information about the remote Docker host, indicating that the connection is successful.

**Note:** Replace `<REMOTE_DOCKER_IP>` with the IP address of the remote Docker host, and `/path/to/client/certs` with the path to your client certificates.
Always ensure that your Docker API is securely configured, especially when exposed over the network. Using TLS is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data interception.
