Benefit of **Keycloak** open source authentication and authorisation service


1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Keycloak supports SSO, allowing users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications. This reduces the need for repeated authentication, enhancing user experience and productivity.
2. **User Federation**: Keycloak can connect to existing user directories like LDAP and Active Directory, allowing seamless integration with existing user bases without needing to migrate users.
3. **Identity Brokering and Social Login**: It enables integration with third-party identity providers and supports social login options like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more, providing users with flexible login options.
4. **Centralized Management**: It provides a centralized place to manage users, roles, and permissions, simplifying the administration of user access across different applications.
5. **Standard Protocols**: Keycloak supports standard protocols like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SAML, ensuring interoperability with a wide range of applications and services.
6. **Security Features**: Keycloak offers robust security features, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), support for password policies, brute force attack protection, and more.
7. **Extensibility**: The platform is highly customizable, allowing the integration of custom extensions to meet specific requirements.
8. **Delegated Administration**: It allows the delegation of administration tasks to different levels of administrators, supporting hierarchical and distributed management.
9. **User Self-Service**: It offers self-service account management features, enabling users to update their profiles, change passwords, and manage their own accounts.
10. **Community and Enterprise Support**: As an open-source solution, Keycloak benefits from a large community of users and developers. Additionally, Red Hat offers enterprise support through Red Hat SSO for organizations needing commercial support and additional features.
11. **Integration with Applications**: Keycloak provides adapters for a variety of platforms and frameworks (Java, Node.js, Spring Boot, etc.), making it easier to integrate authentication and authorization into your applications.
